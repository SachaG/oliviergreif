During the next twenty years, Olivier-Haridas will compose two kinds of works: “classical” compositions (with a gap from 1983 to 1991); arrangements of songs (text and music) by Sri Chinmoy for a choir of disciples.

Performed in the Centre Pompidou, with the help of IRCAM and Festival d’Automne, by Georges Pludermacher (piano), Sylvio Gualda (drums) and singers and musicians of the Paris Opera.While the music is as tense and moving as usual, the book is bungled. It doesn’t really evoke a Japanese Nô, even if four lines of a real Nô are quoted at the end. Olivier Messiaen, who knew and appreciated Olivier Greif, and Pierre Boulez, who didn’t know him, attended together. Olivier’s opera didn’t seem to convince them. The critics were ferocious. Olivier, disappointed and bitter, stopped composing—except the arrangements of Sri Chinmoy melodies for the disciples’ chorus and small piano pieces on the names of his friends. Leduc was ready to publish Nô, but Olivier never returned the proofs he was supposed to edit.
